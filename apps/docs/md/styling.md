## Styling
- Try to be unopionated on styling as possible, and focus on functional customizable components
- For separation of concerns, use shadcn conventions as reasonable defaults. Customizable radix are encapsulated.
- Prefer tailwindcss

## Themes, dark mode


## Form
- we opt for shadcn form (react-hook-form) instead of radix ui form
