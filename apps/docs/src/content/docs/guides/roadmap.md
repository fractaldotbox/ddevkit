title: Roadmap

## Alpha

- Stark

## Next
- Localization
- Dark mode

<!-- TODO github discussions -->
## Plan
We prioritize high demanded components which do not have a standing library.
Solid.js development is meaningful to make the library framework-agnoistic and make dapp more ubitquious, such as in chrome extensions. 

Avoid Next.js dependencies in general

- optimism kit
- support identities besides basename
- examples with multiple wallets / privy, dynamic etc
- Playground
- EAS attestation without ethers dependency
- visualize EFP 
- XMTP
- identity with ENS, basename resolution
- Wagmi
- Frame
